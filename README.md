# FlamApp AI Android + OpenCV + OpenGL ES Starter

This repository is a production-quality starter for an Android app (Kotlin + C++/NDK + OpenCV + OpenGL ES 2.0) and a simple web TypeScript viewer.

- Camera2 capture with toggle for raw vs processed view
- Native image processing (OpenCV: grayscale + Canny) via JNI
- OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer to display frames in real-time
- Scripted OpenCV SDK integration
- Web viewer for a saved processed frame

See README.md later for full instructions.
